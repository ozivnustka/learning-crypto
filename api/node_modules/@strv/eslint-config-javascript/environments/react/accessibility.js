    // in aria-label, the screenreader will treat the emoji as an image in the accessibility tree
    // with an accessible name for the end user.
    'jsx-a11y/accessible-emoji': 'warn',

    // Enforce that all elements that require alternative text have meaningful information to relay
    // back to the end user. This is a critical component of accessibility for screenreader users
    // in order for them to understand the content's purpose on the page. By default, this rule
    // checks for alternative text on the following elements: <img>, <area>, <input type="image">,
    // and <object>.

    // The HTML <a> element, with a valid href attribute, is formally defined as representing a
    // hyperlink. That is, a link between one HTML document and another, or between one location
    // inside an HTML document and another location inside the same document.  In fact, the
    // interactive, underlined <a> element has become so synonymous with web navigation that this
    // expectation has become entrenched inside browsers, assistive technologies such as screen
    // readers and in how people generally expect the internet to behave. In short, anchors should
    // navigate.  The use of JavaScript frameworks and libraries, like React, has made it very easy
    // to add or subtract functionality from the standard HTML elements. This has led to anchors
    // often being used in applications based on how they look and function instead of what they
    // represent.  Whilst it is possible, for example, to turn the <a> element into a fully
    // functional <button> element with ARIA, the native user agent implementations of HTML
    // elements are to be preferred over custom ARIA solutions.

    // aria-activedescendant is used to manage focus within a composite widget. The element with
    // the attribute aria-activedescendant retains the active document focus; it indicates which of
    // its child elements has secondary focus by assigning the ID of that element to the value of
    // aria-activedescendant. This pattern is used to build a widget like a search typeahead select
    // list. The search input box retains document focus so that the user can type in the input. If
    // the down arrow key is pressed and a search suggestion is highlighted, the ID of the
    // suggestion element will be applied as the value of aria-activedescendant on the input
    // element.  Because an element with aria-activedescendant must be tabbable, it must either
